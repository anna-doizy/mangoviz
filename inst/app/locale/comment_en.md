For each experiment, MangoViz is structured into two main tabs: **>> Presentation** and **>> Results**.

The **>> Presentation** tab provides information on the orchard, the experimental design and the protocol. This information includes photographs and figures.

The **>> Results** tab allows to view tree production data, expressed in terms of fruit mass, number of fruits, or mean individual fruit mass (to be selected at the top of the page) with three graphs:
- the distribution of production data by level of the factor tested in the experiment (***pruning method*** or ***variety***)
- the changes in production data over time (***temporal monitoring***)
- the spatialisation of production data in the experimental orchard (***spatial monitoring***)

The basic scale for production data is the tree and the year. Options are available to customise the representation of each graph. These options are specified on each graph by clicking on the ![](circle-question-regular.png) button.

For the varietal evaluation experiment, the **>> Summary sheets** tab provides additional results.
