MangoViz (for Mango Visualization) is an interactive web interface enabling data from medium- and long-term agronomic experiments on mango to be explored graphically. MangoViz is intended for being used by researchers, students, technicians and trainers. Its applications include data exploration prior to statistical analysis, discussion of the data and results of an experiment with graphical support, and training with interactive support. 

Production data from two experiments on mango conducted by the CIRAD HortSys Unit at the Bassin-Plat research station on Reunion Island are presented: a pruning experiment and a varietal evaluation experiment.

MangoViz can be adapted to data from other experiments by modifying the code appropriately.
