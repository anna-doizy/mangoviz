### Objective

The objective of the pruning experiment is to compare the agronomic performance (fruit production, canopy dimensions) of mango trees subjected to different pruning methods.

MangoViz presents fruit production results.


### Experimental orchard


- **Location** : Cirad - Station de Bassin Plat, Saint-Pierre, Reunion Island (21°19’S, 55°29’E, 125m a.s.l)
- **Planting year** : 2004 (experiment completed in 2022)
- **Planting density** : 333 trees / ha (6m x 5m)
- **Variety** : Cogshall
- **Rootstock** : Maison Rouge
- **Experimental design** : complete blocks, 3 blocks, 15 trees per elementary plot


### Pruning methods

- **Unpruned** : trees unpruned since planting
- **Summer pruning** : trees pruned in summer after harvest (end of January - beginning of February)
- **Winter pruning** : trees pruned in winter at the beginning of flowering (end of July - August)

The trees were pruned every second year from 2012 (trees not pruned before this date).


### Studied variables

Each year, the harvest is recorded individually for each tree in the orchard. The ripe fruit is harvested twice a week and counted and weighed for each tree. The variables characterising fruit production are:  

- **Number of fruit** : number of mangoes produced per tree and per year
- **Fruit mass** : total mass of mangoes produced per tree and per year (in kg)
- **Individual fruit mass** : mean mass of a mango per tree and per year (in g)

In this experiment, the harvest takes place from the beginning of December to the beginning of February. The year N shown in the graphs corresponds to the harvest from December of year N to February of year N+1.
