### Objective

The objective of the varietal evaluation is to compare the agronomic performance (fruit production and quality, canopy dimensions, susceptibility to pests and diseases) of 10 mango varieties.

MangoViz presents fruit production results.
Some of the other results are available in the "Summary sheets" tab.


### Experimental orchard


- **Location** : Cirad - Station de Bassin Plat, Saint-Pierre, Reunion Island (21°19’S, 55°29’E, 125m a.s.l)
- **Planting year** : 2007 (experiment still in progress)
- **Planting density** : 278 trees / ha (6m x 6m)
- **Varieties** : see "Presentation of varieties" tab
- **Rootstock** : Maison Rouge
- **Experimental design** : complete randomisation, 13 to 14 trees per variety, guard trees not studied


The trees were not pruned until 2014 in order to record their natural vegetative growth. Heavy pruning was carried out after the harvest in 2015, followed by annual maintenance pruning to maintain tree size.


### Studied variables

Each year, the harvest is recorded individually for each tree in the orchard. The ripe fruit is harvested twice a week and counted and weighed for each tree. The variables characterising fruit production are:  

- **Number of fruit** : number of mangoes produced per tree and per year
- **Fruit mass** : total mass of mangoes produced per tree and per year (in kg)
- **Individual fruit mass** : mean mass of a mango per tree and per year (in g)

In this experiment, the harvest takes place from the beginning of December to the end of March, depending on the variety. The year N shown in the graphs corresponds to the harvest from December of year N to March of year N+1.
