This graph shows the temporal evolution of each cultivar in the orchard. 
In the case where only one cultivar is selected: each grey line corresponds to the trajectory of a tree in the orchard (identified by its coordinates in the plot) and the colored line is the average trajectory of all trees of this cultivar. 
In the case where several cultivars are selected: only the average trajectories per cultivar are shown to avoid making the graph too cluttered. 
Move the mouse (or click on a line if you are on a touch screen) to highlight a given trajectory.
