This graph allows to visualize spatially the temporal evolution of the orchard. 
Each square represents a tree in the orchard and its color indicates the value of the variable. 
Move the mouse over (or press on a square) to obtain the precise value of a tree at a given date. 
This will also highlight the other trees in the plot that are of the same cultivar.
