### Graph reading

This graph shows the **temporal evolution of tree production in the orchard for one or several varieties**.

Varieties can be selected (blue display) or deselected (grey display) by clicking on them. The ![](square-check-regular.png) and ![](trash-solid.png) buttons can be used to select or deselect all, respectively.

- If only one variety is selected, each grey line corresponds to the trajectory of one tree and the coloured line is the mean trajectory of all the trees of this variety. The dotted horizontal black line represents the mean value calculated for all the trees of this variety and for all the years of the experiment.

- If several varieties are selected, only the mean trajectories per variety are shown so as to make the graph more legible.

Move the mouse over a grey line to highlight the trajectory of a tree and its code in the orchard. Move the mouse over the coloured points to obtain the exact value of the mean (when one variety is selected) or the exact mean and the number of trees taken into account in calculating the mean (when several varieties are selected).
