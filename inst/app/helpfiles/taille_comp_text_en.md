### Graph reading

This graph shows the **variability of tree production in the orchard for each pruning method over one or more years**.

Years can be selected (blue display) or deselected (grey display) by clicking on them. The ![](square-check-regular.png) and ![](trash-solid.png) buttons can be used to select or deselect all, respectively.

Each grey dot represents a tree in the orchard and a year. 

For each pruning method, the coloured point represents the mean of all the trees for this pruning method and for the selected years. The coloured area represents the distribution of the values of the variable for the selected years.

Move the mouse over the graph to obtain 
- the tree code in the orchard and the exact value of the variable for the grey dots and
- the exact value of the mean for the coloured points.
