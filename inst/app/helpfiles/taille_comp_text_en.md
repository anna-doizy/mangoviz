This graph shows the variability of trees for each pruning in the orchard. 
Each black dot represents a tree in the orchard. 
The big colored points are the average of the selected variable on all the trees of each cultivar. 
By default, only the years since the first pruning are taken into account, but it is possible, to go a little further, to select the years of your choice.
