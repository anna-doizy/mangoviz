### Graph reading

This graph gives a spatial view of **tree production in the orchard**.

Pruning methods can be selected (blue display) or deselected (grey display) by clicking on them. The ![](square-check-regular.png) and ![](trash-solid.png) buttons can be used to select or deselect all, respectively.

Each square represents a tree in the orchard and its colour indicates the value of the selected variable, by year or averaged over all the years.

Move the mouse over a square to obtain the exact value of the variable for that tree.
This also highlights the other trees in the orchard that received the same pruning method (when several pruning methods are selected).
