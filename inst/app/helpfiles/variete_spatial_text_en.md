### Graph reading

This graph gives a spatial view of **tree production in the orchard**.

Varieties can be selected (blue display) or deselected (grey display) by clicking on them. The ![](square-check-regular.png) and ![](trash-solid.png) buttons can be used to select or deselect all, respectively.

Each square represents a tree in the orchard and its colour indicates the value of the selected variable, by year or averaged over all the years.

Move the mouse over a square to obtain the exact value of the variable for that tree.
This also highlights the other trees of the same variety in the orchard (when several varieties are selected).
