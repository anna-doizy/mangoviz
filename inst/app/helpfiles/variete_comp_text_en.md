This graph shows the variability of trees for each cultivar in the orchard. 
Each black dot represents a tree in the orchard. 
The big colored points are the average of the selected variable on all the trees of each cultivar. 
By default, all the years are taken into account, but it is possible, to go a little further, to select one or more years.
