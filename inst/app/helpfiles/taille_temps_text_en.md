### Graph reading

This graph shows the **temporal evolution of tree production in the orchard for one or several pruning methods**.

Pruning methods can be selected (blue display) or deselected (grey display) by clicking on them. The ![](square-check-regular.png) and ![](trash-solid.png) buttons can be used to select or deselect all, respectively.

- If only one pruning method is selected, each grey line corresponds to the trajectory of one tree and the coloured line is the mean trajectory of all the trees that received this pruning method. The dotted horizontal black line represents the mean value calculated for all the trees that received this pruning method and for all the years of the experiment.

- If several pruning methods are selected, only the mean trajectories per pruning method are shown so as to make the graph more legible.

Move the mouse over a grey line to highlight the trajectory of a tree and its code in the orchard. Move the mouse over the coloured points to obtain the exact value of the mean (when one pruning method is selected) or the exact mean and the number of trees taken into account in calculating the mean (when several pruning methods are selected).

The white vertical line between 2011 and 2012 indicates the beginning of the period when trees are pruned every two years.
